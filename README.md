# Omniauth Xero

[Omniauth Xero](https://github.com/kaleworsley/omniauth-xero) is an [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) authentication strategy for [Xero](http://www.xero.com).

This fork simplifies the OmniAuth strategy, since Xero only supports OAuth not OAuth2, and doesn't supply any user info in the return tokens. As a result, if there is more than one user in the organisation, you get an array of users, and selecting the first one is incorrect, since it doesn't correspond to the user who's logging in.

## Installation

Add this to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth', '~> 1.0.0'
gem 'omniauth-xero'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install omniauth-xero
```

## Usage

Register your public application on the [Xero API site](https://api.xero.com/Application/Add).

For a Rack application:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :xero, CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET
end
```

For a Rails application:

```ruby
# config/intializers/omniauth.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :xero, CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET
end
```

Or, if you use [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication:

```ruby
# config/initializers/devise.rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  config.omniauth :xero, CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET
end
```
